Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Rizky Nurfakhri (Fakhri),5.0,"Gacoan is a famous noodle center. I really love to eating noodle!! Every I come back to my hometown.. I always visit Mie Gacoan at least once. They are provide many variants of noodle, dumpling, and drinks with unique name of the menu... love it and I really recommend this place for u guys that love noodle.. these place is great!!!"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Arif Akbar Kurnia,3.0,"I love the food, undoubtedly, especially udang keju and the eighth level of mie setan above all. However, the fact that this massively well known and very good selling restaurant does not accompany or take environmental concern into account ‚Äîwhich I suppose most of or all of the restaurants‚Äî by using single use styrofoam or plastic products is very deplorable, which worse due to the fact of the possession of good selling and mie setan market domination in cities. According to Kompas.com at least more than a hundred portions of mie setan and mie iblis are sold in Malang. Concerning these unsatisfactory environmental issues, we urge that the manager shall be authoritative and assess for the greater good, to be both econoically and environmentally profitable, and for the worth or five star ranting credit. Lastly, unimportant, I notice there are some notice poster which is grammatically incorrect, they would be better if they were redone."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Ino Iljas,4.0,"The resto only serve take away due to short of employees, when i came there there are many online drivers are waiting for the food. I hae to wait but lucky me they took order differently between online order n walk in order"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Listianto Humam,5.0,"Food is pretty good and cheap, staff is also really friendly. For their prices it's 99% worth it!"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Rizki Ekananda,4.0,"A Viral noodle shop that always has a long queue, we‚Äôve been trying to buy this noodle but always giving up because of the queue and finally we try it when we go to yogya and we still can tolerate the queue. We try mie setan, mie iblis each for level 2 and their udang keju. our impression of this noodle is not worth the hype, maybe they have a long queue because their price is quite cheap for one bowl of noodle with a proper place. Their noodle price is 9k with pangsit goreng topping and udang keju 13k. Even though we are quite upset with the taste of their noodles, their udang keju is a good one and worth it to buy. Price: 5/5 Spicy level: they have a level for the spiciness Fav menu: udang keju Place: spacious with foodcourt themes"

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,bugar ashari,5.0,"(Translated by Google) spacious place, There are indoor and outdoor Nice to hang out The minus is the grass carpet is muddy items, The wooden chair is a bit sticky, The taste of the noodles is delicious, The angel in my opinion is a bit salty, The level 4 demon noodles are quite spicy, Strategic location close to the city center, (Original) Tempat luas, Ada yg indoor ada outdoor, Enak buat nongkrong, Minusnya karpet rumputnya becek item, Kursi ma kayu nya agak lengket, Rasa mie nya enak, Yang angel menurutku agak asin, Yang mie iblis level 4 cukup pedes, Lokasi strategis dekat dengan pusat kota,"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Rani Pratiwi,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Even though I went to Jogja, I was curious to try dine-in at Gacoan, it turned out that it could only be take away I wanted to buy it at 8 o'clock at night, it turned out that the queue was very busy, not recommended for those who are starving. finally the next morning at 9 o'clock I came back again so that the queue wasn't so crowded, it turned out that there were already several drivers queuing up at least not waiting to be irritated. The taste of Devil's Noodle is level 4, 8/10 for my level 4 Devil's noodle, the rating is 8.5/10. the cheese prawns are champions! I've tried the rambutan shrimp but I prefer the cheese shrimp I hope we can open branches all over Indonesia (Original) padahal ke Jogja penasaran mau cobain dine in di Gacoan, ternyata cuma bisa take away mau beli malem jam 8an ternyata yg antri ramee banget, sangat tidak rekomended buat yg udah kelaperan. akhirnya keesokan pagi jam 9an aku balik lagi supaya ga begitu rame antrian, ternyata yah sudah beberapa driver yg antri ü§£ setidaknya ga menunggu sampe jengkel. Rasa Mie Iblis level 4, 8/10 untuk mie Setan level 4 ku rating 8,5/10. udang kejunya juara! udah coba udang rambutan tapi lebih suka yg udang keju semoga bisa buka cabang keseluruh Indonesia"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Annisa Dwita Nur Fauzia,5.0,"(Translated by Google) It's time to come here If I myself like noodles that are devilish because they have sweetness, if you want it not too spicy, you can choose level 2 For the delicious dimsum, I like cheese shrimp and rambutan shrimp the most Very juicy (Original) Udah seting mampir kesini Kalo aku sendiri suka mie yang iblis soalnya ada manis2nya kalo pengen ga terlalu pedes bisa pilih yang level 2 Untuk dimsumnya enak paling suka udang keju dan udang rambutan Juicy bangettü§§ü§§"

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Saripudin,5.0,(Translated by Google) Friendly and steady price gacoan. Short description for this food. Restaurant but a bit to cafes. Suitable for dining for two to family groups. Mii devil and dimsum are still champions to try. A good time to avoid queuing around 2‚Äê4. Before and after that will definitely be a long queue. (Original) Gacoan harga bersahabat dan mantap. Deskripsi singkat untuk makanan ini. Restoran tapi agak ke cafe‚Äêcafe an. Cocok untuk makan berdua hingga family grup. Mii iblis dan dimsum masih tetap juara untuk wajib dicoba. Waktu yg bagus biar ga antri sekitaran jam 2‚Äê4. Sebelum dan sesudah itu pasti akan antri panjang.
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Yethi Anindi Novita,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is easy to reach, the area is strategic, the price is okay, the service is decent, the queue is quite orderly, it's just a little long to wait for the order to be delivered. When visiting, only 1 toilet can be used. (Original) Tempatnya mudah dijangkau, areanya strategis, harganya oke, pelayanannya lumayan, antriannnya cukup tertib, hanya saja sedikit lama untuk menunggu pesanannya diantar. Saat berkunjung, toilet yg bisa digunakan hanya 1."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Widya Maharani,5.0,"(Translated by Google) First time trying dine-in at the Mie Gacoan outlet. Usually just go food. Very busy but unfortunately the cashier is not friendly. Please pay attention to the attitude of each employee. As for the taste of the food, it's not bad. It's just that now it tastes more delicious (Original) Pertama kali cobain dine in di outlet mie gacoan. Biasanya go food aja. Rame banget tapi sayang kasirnya ga ramah. Tolong di perhatikan attitude setiap karyawannya. Untuk rasa dari makanannya sih not bad lah.cuma skrg kayaknya rasanya lebih gurih"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Sri Raehanti M,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The gacoan devil noodles are always delicious, especially the cheese prawns. The dumplings are getting smaller and smaller, but still delicious. The service is a bit long, the food has arrived but the drink takes a long time to arrive. Maybe because it's very crowded. The queue was also long, at that time only 1 active cashier (Original) Mie iblis gacoan emang selalu enak, udang kejunya apalagi. Siomaynya makin kesini makin kecil, tapi tetap enak. Pelayanannya agak lama, Makanannya udah nyampe tapi minumnya lama banget nyampe. Mungkin karena lagi ramai banget. Antriannya juga lama, saat itu kasir yang aktif cuma 1"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Yulia Soesilo,5.0,"(Translated by Google) No need to buy it in line like a snake. It tastes really good especially at a very cheap price. I bought it using grab the price is 14,000 then there is a 35% discount from grab if you buy 40,000. The noodle texture is chewy with a small round shape. Even though the chicken is crushed and very smooth, it tastes really good. Not to mention spicy. That's great! The dumplings are not canned, the filling is very thick. Look at the photo. A recommendation for noodle lovers. The devil's noodle is the white one, while the devil's noodle is the one with sweet soy sauce. 2 2 are delicious. Just according to taste. (Original) Pantesan belinya ngantri kayak ular. Rasanya enak banget apalagi dengan harga yang sangat murah. Saya beli pake grab harganya 14.000 trus ada diskon 35% dari grab kalo beli 40.000. Tekstur bakmi nya kenyal dengan bentuk bulat kecil. Ayamnya walaupun hancur dan halus sekali tapi berasa banget. Belum lagi pedas. Mantap banget dah! Pangsitnya gak kaleng2, isiannya tebal banget. Liat deh di foto. Rekomen dah buat para pecinta bakmi. Mie setan tuh yg putih sedangkan mie iblis tuh yg pake kecap manis. 2 2 nya enak. Sesuai selera aja."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Nnn Afana,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Can't eat on the spot. Queuing with the food driver brothers. I thought it would be separated because when I ordered, there was a different place to order. Then when you take the order, the food is not neatly arranged on the crackle, so until the house the oil comes out. (Original) Ga bisa makan ditempat. Antri bareng abang¬≤ driver makanan. Kirain bakal dipisah karna waktu pesan beda tempat pemesanan. Terus waktu ambil pesanan, makananya tidak ditata rapi di kresek jadi sampe rumah minyaknya pada keluar."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Rista Nur Destianti,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The noodles are addicting, the spicy is demanding poll.. especially the dimsum with cheese shrimp is the best, don't forget the rambutan shrimp add genderuwo ice, no medicine, mantuulll (Original) Mienya bikin candu, pedesnya nagih poll.. apalagi dimsumnya udang keju terdabest siih trus jangan lupakan udang rambutannyaaü§§ü§§ü§§ ditambah es genderuwo bahh gada obat dehh, mantuulll"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Hyacintha Dian Tatiwi,5.0,"(Translated by Google) I ordered a level 8 demon noodle via grabfood, for a very affordable price. It tastes good, the texture of the noodles is just right, and for the level of spiciness it's steady, it's perfect for lovers of spicy food. Even though I ordered the spiciest level, the noodle seasoning still tasted. Recommended (Original) Aku pesan mie iblis level 8 via grabfood, untuk harga sangat terjangkau sih. Rasanya enak, tekstur mie nya pas, dan untuk tingkat kepedasannya mantap, cocok sih untuk para pencinta makanan pedas. Meski pesan level yang paling pedas, masih berasa bumbu mie nya. Recommended"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Dina Meylaa,3.0,"(Translated by Google) it's delicious, but why is the order level 2 that comes like level 6, there's a lot of chili Even though I usually buy level 2 it's not spicy at all, at the godean branch, it's the same, ordered level 2 but there's a lot of chili (Original) enak sih ,tapi ini kenapa pesen level 2 yg datang kaya level 6 , banyak bgt cabe nya pdhal biasa beli level 2 ga pedes sama sekali, di cabang yg godean juga sama aja ,pesen level 2 tapi cabe nya banyak bgt"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Desi Citra Dewi,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Offline ordering and ojol are one, so the queue can be really long... the food doesn't take so long to arrive... (Original) Pemesanan offline dan ojol jadi satu, makanya antriannya bisa panjang bgt.. makanan nya ga begitu lama datengnyaaaa.."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Yenny,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Basically the level 1 devil's noodles are pretty good, the shrimp spring rolls and rambutan shrimp are also delicious, the orange juice is okay, unfortunately the fried dumplings are a bit musty (Original) Basicly mie setan level 1 ini lumayan enak, lumpia udang dan udang rambutannyabjuga enak, orange juice oke, sayang pangsit gorengnya agak apek"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Aini Ummy Hanifah,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The gacoan noodles are delicious, but I prefer the ditamsis one. but actually for the taste of 11/12. The cheese prawns are a must try. rate 8/10 (Original) mie gacoan enak poll, tp lebih suka yg ditamsis. tp sebenernya untuk rasa 11/12. udang kejuu wajibun dicobaa. rate 8/10"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Fadli Rayhan,3.0,"(Translated by Google) It tasted okay, when I got there it was a bit quiet but the service was quite long too, the noodles seemed very salty (Noodles Angel) and the matcha drinks were sweet, overall okay for those looking for cheap food, the portions are also sufficient. (Original) Rasanya lumayan, saat kesana agak sepi tapi pelayanan lumayan lama juga, mie nya terkesan sangat asin (Mie Angel) dan minuman matcha yang kemanisan, overall oke untuk yang cari makanan murah, porsi juga cukupan."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Haonisa Shaumi,5.0,"(Translated by Google) This is the queue that invites the commotion, isn't it? Haha It's natural to queue, the price is cheap and the taste is also pretty good. This branch is busy with ojol, but those who dine in are still accommodated with available seats (I arrived at 11.30). It does take a long time to wait for the food, so don't come here when you're really hungry :') so the stomach can be patient. I ordered Mie Devil level 4 (less spicy, for those who like spicy, maybe you can order level 8 and above), and this rambutan dimsum won. Hot dipped into the spicy sour sauce. Besttt! Hopefully it will open in Bogor soon. (Original) Ini yang antriannya mengundang keributan itu ya? Hehe Wajar sih antri, harganya murah dan rasanya juga lumayan. Cabang ini ramai ojol, tapi kalau yang dine in masih terakomodir dengan kursi yang tersedia (saya datang jam 11.30). Memang jadi agak lama ya nunggu makanannya, makanya kesini jangan pas kelaperan banget :') jadi perutnya bisa bersabar. Saya pesan Mie Iblis level 4 (kurang pedas, bagi yang suka pedas mungkin bisa pesan level 8 keatas), dan terjuara si dimsum rambutan ini. Panas-panas dicocol ke kuah asam pedas. Besttt! Semoga secepatnya buka di Bogor."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Ayunitasari,5.0,(Translated by Google) Pretty good compared to that price.. 15 thousand already got the same drink.. the place is also cool.. you can really bring children.. the place is also spacious.. No wonder many are willing to queue.. Next time I will go there again when I go back to Jogja anyway.. (Original) Lumayan enak dibanding dengan harga segitu.. 15rb udah dapet sama minum.. tempat juga asik.. bisa banget bawa anak-anak.. luas juga tempatnya.. Pantes banyak yang rela antre.. Next bakal ke sana lagi kalo pas pulang ke Jogja pokoknya.. Parking: Parkir pas jam makan siang lumayan padat.. bawa mobil cari parkir agak susah.
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,vntaeexie,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The first time I finally got to try gacoan, it tasted good but it wasn't strong enough for level 8 hahaha, the service was friendly, but it was crowded and you had to wait to be seated, it's worth the wait, next time I go to Jogja again I'll stop by here (Original) Pertama kali akhirnya bisa nyoba gacoan,rasanya enak tapi ternyata ga kuat buat yang level 8 hhahaha, pelayanan nya ramah,tapi rame terus harus nunggu dulu buat mau duduk nya,worth it lah buat ditunggu next kalo ke jogja lagi bakal mampir sini"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Yuliarta Kurnia Pramai Sella,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The difference is the Gacoan noodle in Surabaya, here the oil is more and the fried is crispy but not hard. It's not good for me to have to hang around for reasons of lack of employees. So it doesn't feel like the vibe of eating at the place hehe. But overall it's good. (Original) Bedanya sama mie gacoan surabaya, disini minyaknya lebih banyak dan gorengannya renyah tapi ga keras. Ga enaknya saya harus ngemper dgn alasan kekurangan pegawai. Jadi ga berasa vibe makan di tempatnya hehe. But overall enakk."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Rara Nana,3.0,"(Translated by Google) Inexpensive. That's why teenagers like it. But for mothers and fathers, it seems less. Drinks are normal too. The Thai tea is pretty good. (Original) Murah. Makanya Anak2 abg remaja pd suka. Tp kl buat ibuk2 bapak2 kyknya kurang. Minuman jg biasa aja. Thai tea nya lumayan enak."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,indah ulfa,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Suitable for full nongki hihi, the price is cheap and the taste is decent. I like the rambutan shrimp menu the most. Only drawback at that time was a bit confused when I wanted to park the car. (Original) Cocok buat nongki kenyang hihi harga murah dan rasa lumayan. Aku paling suka menu udang rambutan. Cuma kekurangannya waktu itu agak bingung aja pas mau parkir mobil."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Hastin Pratiwi,4.0,"(Translated by Google) I've always been curious, what makes this Gacoan Noodle so popular among young people? Oohh... apparently because the price might be suitable for boarding children... even though there are a lot of people who eat, lo, from office workers. Btw, I really like the drink. The syrup aroma is not marketable, it really makes you drool when you look at it during the day in the scorching hot sun. Ô∏è (Original) Dari dulu penasaran, apa sih yang bikin Mie Gacoan ini populer banget di kalangan anak muda? Oohh... ternyata karena harganya yang mungkin cocok untuk anak kos yakk.. üòÅ meskipun yang makan juga banyak, lo, dari kalangan pekerja kantoran. Btw, saya suka banget dengan minumannya. Aroma sirupnya gak pasaran, bikin ngiler beneran kalau dipandang siang-siang di tengah terik matahari yang kegirangan. ü§≠"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Maylinda Kristina,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Strategic location The size of the place is medium, when you get there you have to wait for other customers to come home just to get a seat. The taste of the noodles and drinks is good, only the dumplings are a bit less crispy. (Original) Lokasi strategis Ukuran tempat sedang, waktu kesana harus menunggu pelanggan lain pulang baru dapat tempat duduk. Rasa mie dan minuman enak, cuma untuk pangsitnya agak kurang crispy."

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Rifki,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Even though the queue seems long, the service is fast, one set sat set. The taste of the noodles is also good, level 3 is really level 3 and doesn't look like level 4. Just a suggestion if you come here at 10:00. While it's quiet (Original) Walaupun antriannya kelihatannya panjang tapi pelayanannya cepat sat set sat set. Rasa mienya juga enak, level 3 bener bener level 3 dan ga mirip level 4. Cuma saran kalau kesini jam 10.00 aja. Mumpung sepi üòÅ"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,dwi rani,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The taste is too sweet, the portion is comparable to the price of the 'mid-month student pocket' Ordered somay, the sambal is also very sweet. Overall it's ok, for those who like to eat sweet things, it might be suitable. (Original) Rasa terlalu manis, porsi sebanding lah dengan harga 'kantong mahasiswa pertengahan bulan' Mesen somay, sambel juga manis pake banget. Overall ok lah, buat yg suka makan manis¬≤ mungkin cocok."
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Zulfikar Ali Mukti,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The service was super fast, it didn't come until 10 minutes and the food came right away... Only the toilet and hand washing area were under repair. The place is comfortable and there is music. Not hot because the place is open. For this food, because my taste is 7/10, the noodles are too oily and it doesn't give an impression on the tongue either. The only thing that is delicious in my opinion is the rambutan shrimp (Original) Pelayanannya super cepat dateng, baru dateng gk sampe 10 menit langsung datang makanannya... Cuma toilet dan tempat cuci tangan sedang dalam perbaikan. Tempatnya nyaman terus ada musik-musiknya. Gk gerah karena tempatnya terbuka. Buat soal makanan ini karena selera saya beri nilai 7/10 terlalu oily mienya dan ya gk ngasih kesan juga di lidah. Yg enak menurut saya udang rambutannya aja"
Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Mutiatul Muafifah,5.0,"(Translated by Google) It's cheap, that's a definite poll, and there must be a lot of polls... even though it's still delicious, it's consistently delicious.

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,DE DE,5.0,"(Translated by Google) When we got there at 11 pm, when we first arrived, it was still quiet, the longer it got crowded. Especially at lunchtime it gets busier. The place is quite spacious. Can dine in and take away. Very authentic place. The table is flat from wood. If you make the noodles taste good, it's like dim sum etc. It's always busy. Enough parking space for motorbikes. Overall good place (Original) Pas kesana jam 11 siang, awal dateng masih sepi makin lama makin rame. Apalagi jam makan siang makin rame. Tempatnya lumayan luas. Bisa dine in dan take away. Autentik sekali tempatnya. Mejanya rata2 dri kayu. Kalau buat rasa mie nya enak sma dimsum dll. Pantes selalu rame. Tempat parkir cukup buat motor ajaa.

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Yustisi kartika Putri,4.0,"(Translated by Google) A place to eat noodles with a variety of spicy creations. The place is near the kridosono roundabout. Here is less applying prokes. Even though a hand washing area is provided, there is no body temperature check and also when queuing there is no distance. The place is very crowded and the queue for ojol is extraordinary. Here there is only one cashier queue, so there is a mix between ojol and non ojol. Maybe tomorrow 2 cashiers will be made so that the queue doesn't drag on. The menu here has a variety of noodle flavors, salty and sweet, spicy and not spicy. For the dimsum menu, there are many starting from fried and steamed. For a very affordable price. Waiters are also quite friendly. (Original) Tempat makan mie dengan berbagai kreasi pedas. Tempatnya di dekat bunderan kridosono. Disini kurang menerapkan prokes. Walaupum disediakan tempat cuci tangan, tapi tidak ada cek suhu badan dab juga ketika antri tidak ada jaga jarak. Tempatnya ramai sekali dan antrian ojolnya luar biasa. Disini hanya disediakan satu antrian kasir jadi campir antara ojol dan non ojol. Mungkin besok2 dibuat 2 kasir kali ya supaya antriannya tidak mengular. Menu disini ada berbagai macam rasa mie ada asin dan manis, pedas dan tidak pedas. Untuk menu dimsumnyaada banyak mulai dr goreng dan kukus. Untuk harga sangat terjangkau. Pelayanam juga cukup ramah."

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Hanan Nabilah,4.0,"(Translated by Google) It's been busy on twitter, so I'm curious what kind of gacoan noodles are. I accidentally ate at Jogja, because it wasn't in Jakarta yet. The food menu variants are not too many, but the drinks are quite diverse. Yesterday decided to order: - angel noodles (salty noodles are not spicy): delicious, served with two fried dumplings, good chicken topping and mini dumpling chips. Suitable for children because it is not spicy at all - Mie devil level 1: delicious, not too spicy, the topping is the same as the angle noodles. - all the dim sum menus (except claws), but the only recommended ones are shrimp spring rolls and fried dumplings. The rest is normal - all ice devils (except sundel bolong ice): it's delicious, it's fresh. -thai tea green tea: standard Overall for food and drinks at prices that are said to be cheap, this is really good... what else if it's for school or college kids But it's a shame, the bathroom is a bit smelly and the prayer room is leaking :( I hope it can be fixed in the future (Original) Sempet rame di twitter, jadi penasaran kayak apa sih mie gacoan itu. Gak sengaja malah makan di jogja, karena belum ada di jakarta. Untuk varian menu makanan gak terlalu banyak, tapi minumannya lumayan macem-macem. Kemarin memutuskan untuk order: - mie angel (mie asin aja gak pedes): enak, disajiin pake pangsit goreng dua biji, topping ayam alus gitu dan keripik pangsit mini. Cocok buat anak-anak karena gak pedes sama sekali -mie setan level 1: enak, gak terlalu pedes, topping sama kayak mie angle. -semua menu dimsum (kecuali ceker), tapi yang cukup rekomen cuma lumpia udang dan pangsit goreng. Sisanya biasa aja sih -semua es setan (kecuali es sundel bolong): enakkk enak deh, seger. -thai tea green tea: standar Overall untuk makanan dan minuman dengan harga yang dibilang murah, ini enak sih.. apa lagi kalau buat anak sekolah atau kuliah üòÉüëãüèº Tapi sayang sekali, kamar mandinya agak bau dan tempat sholatnya bocor :( semoga bisa diperbaiki kedepannya"

Mie Gacoan Kotabaru,Sugiura Tadayoshi,1.0,"(Translated by Google) Came at half past eight in the evening with family members visiting from far away. We lined up for quite a long time, then one of the waiters asked us if we wanted to eat on the spot or take away, we said eat on the spot, the waiter then advised us to write down the order on a small piece of paper he gave while waiting for an empty table. There are two cashiers provided, namely online order cashiers and direct order cashiers, but only one cashier is filled, namely online order cashiers so that all queue at one mixed cashier where visitors are crowded and the queue becomes long. Until it was our turn to order, the cashier curtly said ""have you got a place?"" We also said ""no ma'am"", and the cashier then said ""find a place first, make sure you get a new place to order"". And than I said ""Oh, OK"". We went back and forth looking for an empty table to be occupied immediately because it seemed as if we were fighting with other visitors. After getting an empty table and waiting for our order to arrive, I immediately tasted my order, which was a portion of ""angel"" noodles which were said to be selling well and supposedly the taste was also delicious, but unfortunately it didn't match my perspective. If it weren't for curiosity and not in a hurry to catch up with dinner time, we might have left earlier since we were ordered to find an empty table ourselves. Sorry to say but this is the real fact and I'll never visit this place anymore. :) (Original) Datang pukul setengah delapan malam dengan membawa anggota keluarga yang berkunjung dari tempat yang jauh. Kami antree dengan cukup panjang, kemudian salah satu pelayan menanyakan kami ingin makan di tempat atau dibungkus, kami pun mengatakan makan di tempat, pelayannya kemudian memberi saran ke kami untuk menuliskan pesanan di selembar kertas kecil yang dia berikan sembari menunggu meja yang kosong. Terdapat dua kasir yang disediakan, yaitu kasir pesanan online dan kasir order langsung, tapi hanya satu kasir yang terisi yaitu kasir pesanan online sehingga semua mengantri di satu kasir yang dicampur dimana pengunjung ramai dan antrean pun menjadi panjang. Sampai pada saat giliran kami memesan, kasir dengan ketus berkata ""udah dapat tempat?"" Kami pun berkata ""belum Mbak"", dan si kasir kemudian mengatakan ""cari tempat dulu, pastikan dapat tempat baru bisa pesan"". And than I said ""Oh, Oke"". Kami pun hilir mudik mencari meja yang kosong untuk segera ditempati karena seolah berebut dengan pengunjung lainnya. Setelah dapat meja kosong dan menunggu hingga pesanan kami datang, saya pun segera mencicipi pesanan saya yaitu seporsi mie ""bidadari"" yang katanya luar biasa laris dan konon rasanya pun juga nikmat, tapi sayangnya tidak sesuai dengan aspektasi saya. Kalau tidak karena rasa penasaran dan tidak terburu untuk mengejar waktu makan malam, mungkin kami sudah lebih dulu angkat kaki sejak diperintah untuk mencari meja kosong sendiri. Sorry to say but this is the real fact and I'll never visit this place anymore. :)"

Curious, is there a difference between the ones in Semarang üòÇ In Jogja, the place is more aesthetic, cool, the style of Jogja is the main point, wkwk. There is a prayer room, the bathroom is also clean. Not enough parking space, So maybe for a car it's quite difficult. Social distancing is implemented by the employees. So it's really limited to sit down, for example, for 2 chairs 1 table but filled with 3 people, it's immediately reprimanded and looked for elsewhere. But I don't know why when I go there when it's not so crowded, the food takes so long to be delivered. Have to ask her again to be delivered.

Mie Gacoan Semarang,Ananta Kanoko,5.0,"This business has a good potential to be very successful. The food option is not small. There's plenty of beverage option, and the uniques one such as Es Pocong or Es Genderuwo is quite refreshing. The price is definitely affordable. Unfortunately, there's no Mi Kuah or Noodle with soup/broth here, only fried (goreng) noodles. The appetizer is very appetizing, delicious, and worth the price. My favourite is Mi Angel with Udang Keju (Angel noodles with cheese-filled and breaded shrimp meatballs). The service is excellent, very friendly, and quite fast. Unfortunately, even before the opening time, people are already there, queuing. So chances are, the queue line is already long by the time you get there. That's how successful this noodle joint are right now. Oh, not to mention there's a parking fee. TL;DR Decent food, worth the price, excellent service. Recommended? Yes"

Mie Gacoan Semarang,abdurrohman nugroho,3.0,"Mie gacoan is a favorite place to eat for most people. People can enjoy delicious and cheap noodles. But it's a shame if you want to eat there you have to have extra patience, because the queues are long and sometimes the food comes first and the drinks come when our food is finished. It's better to bring drinks first than food so that visitors don't interfere with their meal"
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Bayu Aji,3.0,It's cheap. Place is big and parking is also spacious. I might have visited on one of their worst days because it was very crowded and so the service was awfully slow. The noodle dishes we ordered served cold. Well you can imagine cold oily noodle. We also ordered dimsum that I thought would at least be served warm. However it was also cold. Several things could be improved including how they deliver the food to customers using a numbered signage. I found the waiters walk around me looking confused several times for not finding the number they were looking for. They were definitely overwhelmed by the crowded visitors. The place is definitely aiming for those teenagers/students looking for a place to hang out. I don't think i'll be back unless somebody asks to meet there.

But its fair price.. cheap for thats all we got.."
Mie Gacoan Mawar,Bismi Rakasiwi,3.0,"The place is quite cozy and ""instagramable"". The foods are good and the price is cheap. I ordered Curry noodles with two pieces of spring rolls for Rp. 12000. However, the lemon tea I ordered didn't taste real at all. I could taste the instant powder in it. Their system was kind of unpleasant, instead of giving numbers for each table which will make it easier for the waiters to deliver the foods to customers, they will shout the customer's name out loud to find which table they are on. They also didn't provide tissue and extra sauce."
Mie Gacoan Mawar,bungaa widi,4.0,"the place is good for hanging out.

Mie Gacoan Mawar,C Bunz,4.0,Be ready for a long queue (when long means long) esp when youre there for dinner. Cheap price yummy taste but you have to be patient while waiting your food to be ready. We were waiting for about 30-45 mins on last friday night. Try their best Mie Iblis for spicy but sweet noodle or mie setan for spicy but salty noodle. Mie Iblis is definetely my favorite. It has spicy level from 0 (not spicy at all) to 8 (super spicy)

Mie gacoan is a bowl or a plate of noodle, fried noodle, which contain a lot of spice and chillies! Yesss the flavor is dominated by hot flavor! But guys, stay calm, you can choose your spicy level, or if you cant eat spicy foods at all you can order Angel noodle wkwkwk. Anddd there's also another menu, it's dim sum! But must of dim sum rite there are fried not steamed üòÇ And the beverages? You can get flavored milks, or mixed fruits with milk and syrup soup, or just an original ice tea. The prices? Oh don't worry, for the dimsum you just need to pay 9k rupiahs, for the noodle? You just need 10k until 11k, it depends on your spicy level. Beverages? For flavored milks you just need 9k rupiahs. Happy tummy, happy people!"

This place have free wifi but you need to ask the password first if you want to connect to the wifi and also good ambiance, feels like home. The parking lot are spacious especially for motorcycle.

The first ten minutes, they gave us the baverages, the next ten minutes they give us the dimsum. And when almost an hour they just deliver the food.

They do in fact place the reminder and warnings to maintain health protocol but they're too busy handling the orders. Had to wait another 45 mins for my orders to complete. The food is good though for those who love spicy foods, and the best thing is they come cheap. The parking lot is very spacious, loved it."

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Nur Arifah,3.0,"(Translated by Google) strategic location, right on the edge of the highway so easy to find. sometimes there is a parking attendant, sometimes not. parking is also a little limited. 2k motorbike parking. the atmosphere is not much different from other branches; noisy, a little hot, and a little noisy. for dine in, the place might be expanded again. other than that, the fan doesn't reach the dine-in area thoroughly. the server was quick to clean the table. I didn't have to wait long to get my order. However, I was confused because there were no eating tissues and cutlery like the student garden branch. may be re-evaluated. for seasoning, for some reason I think it can be fixed again. the sesame oil is lacking, the toppings are shrinking, a little less savory, and so on. the dimsum is a little bland but the iced tea smells good, I think it's delicious. unfortunately, the dumpling dimsum container was a bit dirty and seemed rarely cleaned until it was really clean. so, please clean it better so that the customer's appetite does not decrease. the plate is also not clean because it is covered with oil. the price is standard like other branches. avoid lunch hours, weekends, and late afternoon if you are interested in dine-in. (Original) lokasinya strategis, tepat di tepi jalan raya sehingga mudah ditemukan. tukang parkirnya kadang ada, kadang nggak ada. parkiran juga sedikit terbatas. parkir motor 2k. suasananya tidak jauh berbeda dengan cabang lain; bising, agak panas, dan sedikit berisik. untuk dine in, tempatnya mungkin bisa diperluas lagi. selain itu, kipas anginnya tidak menjangkau area dine in secara menyeluruh. servernya sigap membersihkan meja. saya tidak perlu menunggu lama untuk mendapatkan pesanan. namun, saya sempat bingung karena tidak disediakan tissue makan serta sendok-garpu seperti cabang taman siswa. mungkin bisa dievaluasi kembali. untuk seasoning, entah mengapa menurut saya bisa diperbaiki kembali. minyak wijennya kurang, toppingnya menyusut, kurang gurih sedikit, dst. dimsumnya sedikit hambar tapi es tehnya wangi lho, menurut saya enak. sayangnya, wadah siomay dimsumnya agak kotor dan terkesan jarang dibersihkan sampai benar-benar bersih. jadi, mohon dibersihkan lebih baik lagi agar selera makan pelanggan tidak menurun. piringnya juga kurang bersih karena belepotan minyak. harganya standar seperti cabang lain. hindari jam makan siang, waktu weekend, dan sore menjelang malam jika berminat untuk dine in."
Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,iwan wibowo,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The noodles are delicious and filling, even though it's only 1 serving. The prawns are also very delicious. Spicy can request level 1-9. I ordered level 4, it's really spicy. Motorcycle parking is quite wide, if the car has to park along the road. The dining area is on the 1st & 2nd floor. There is also a prayer room on the 2nd floor. The service is very fast, less than 10 minutes it has been served. (Original) Mienya enak dan mengenyangkan, padahal cuman 1 porsi. Udangnya juga enak banget. Pedesnya bisa request level 1-9. Saya pesen level 4, pedesnya dah nampol banget. Parkiran motor cukup luas, kalo mobil harus parkir di sepanjang jalan. Area makan ada di lantai 1 & 2. Ada mushola juga di lantai 2. Pelayanannya gercep banget, gak sampe 10 menit sudah disajikan. Kid-friendliness: Untuk anak2 yg gak doyan pedes bisa pilih menu mie angel atau mie level 0."
Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,tsabitah el-rahmah,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Just like other branch of Gacoan noodles. The menu is complete, the prices are affordable, and the portions are just right. The queue wasn't too long and the wait wasn't too long either because it wasn't that crowded. The noodles are decent. It just tastes less salty. Because I ordered level 6, it tasted spicy and a bit bitter because of the cayenne pepper. Overall, good enough. (Original) Sama seperti mie gacoan cabang lainnya. Menu komplit, harga terjangkau, dan porsi juga pas. Antri tidak terlalu panjang dan menunggunya juga tidak begitu lama karena sedang tidak begitu ramai. Mienya lumayan. Hanya saja rasanya kurang asin. Karena saya order level 6, rasanya jadi pedas dan agak pahit karena cabai rawitnya. Overall, good enough."

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,ariani widya,5.0,"(Translated by Google) I've eaten noodles at Gacoan several times, for the taste, sometimes it's really good, sometimes it's right, sometimes there's something missing :( The dimsum is delicious, I like the cheese prawns and the prawn spring rolls the most. For the dimsum sauce, the old one is better than the current one (sachet). From the gacoan place in solo, here is the most comfortable. Spacious place, not too noisy when it's crowded üëç For the upper bathroom, the faucet often turns off. Maybe it can be repaired, sis, so that it doesn't go down if you want to do ablution. For good service sis üëç (Original) Sudah beberapa kali makan mie di gacoan, untuk rasa kadang enak banget kadang pas kadang ada yang kurang :( Dimsumnya enak, paling suka yang udang keju sama lumpia udangnya. Untuk saos dimsum lebih enak yang dulu daripada yang sekarang ( sachetan ). Dari tempat gacoan di solo, disini yang paling nyaman. Tempat yang luas, gak terlalu bising kalau pas rame üëç Untuk kamar mandi atas, kran sering mati. Mungkin bisa diperbaiki lagi kak, biar gak turun ke bawah kalau mau wudhu. Untuk pelayanan bagus kak üëç"
Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Winihen 378,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Taste is the same as any other branch. Spicy noodles share levels with pocket friendly prices. My favorite variety of dimsum.

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Dania,5.0,"(Translated by Google) One of the most popular foods among teenagers, now there are three branches in Solo but it's still busy (cmiiw). Most like the gacoan sauce, it's sweet. The main menu is noodles, there are angel noodles (not spicy), devil noodles (there are several levels, without soy sauce), and devil noodles (there are several levels, with soy sauce) The queue at certain hours is very busy. If you want to take away, it's better to go through go/grap/shopee-food or etc, because the place is very busy so I'm afraid it won't be comfortable when you wait or you won't hear it when you're called. Or if not, wait for it while you dine-in, the order will be delivered and the dine-in food will be delivered. (Original) Salah satu makanan paling populer di kalangan remaja, sekarang uda ada tiga cabang di Solo tapi tetep aja rame (cmiiw). Paling suka sama saos gacoan, manis gitu. Menu utamanya mie, ada mie angel (ga pedes), mie setan (ada beberapa level, tanpa kecap), dan mie iblis (ada beberapa level, dengan kecap) Antriannya kalo jam-jam tertentu rame banget. Kalo mau take away, saran aja mending lewat go/grap/shopee-food or etc, karena tempatnya rame banget jadi takutnya ga nyaman pas nunggu atau ga kedengeran pas dipanggil. Atau kalo engga, nunggunya sambil dine in nanti pesanannya dianter sekalian makanan dine in nya."

It's best not to be too spicy the taste will be lost. (Original) Panas tempatnya, mie nya yang gurih asin aja, enakan y ada kuah manisnya. Sebaiknya jangan terlalu pedas hilang nanti rasanya."
Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,farraas fadlilah,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Price : 5/5 Taste : 4/5 Venue: 5/5 Service : 5/5 The price is affordable with enough portions, you can choose the spicy level according to your taste, lots of side dishes too. For the taste of Gacoan noodles, it tends to be salty. The place is spacious, quite clean. Maybe a fork can be provided for people who can't use chopsticks like me hehe. If you use a spoon, it's still hard to eat the noodles. (Original) Harga : 5/5 Rasa : 4/5 Tempat: 5/5 Pelayanan : 5/5 Harganya terjangkau dengan porsi cukup, bisa pilih level pedas sesuai selera, banyak makanan pendamping juga. Untuk rasa mie Gacoan memang cenderung asin. Tempatnya luas, cukup bersih. Mungkin bisa disediakan garpu bagi orang-orang yg tidak bisa pakai sumpit seperti saya hehe. Kalau pake sendok masih susah makan mienya."
Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,nur fatimah,5.0,(Translated by Google) Devil's noodle recommendation anyway.. It's good to have sweet and sweet if you don't like spicy food The drink is genderuwo ice that goes well with spicy noodles (Original) Rekomendasi mie iblis sih ..

I arrived at 20.00 and it seemed like it was about to close, so the employee lifted the chair to the table. Looks like the order closes at 21.00 WIB.. (Original) Seperti gacoan pada umumnya pasti kalau kesini minimal harus antri tapi alhmdulillah pelayanan sekarang sangat cepat.

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Tina Nur Khasanah,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The taste is very standard, I just thought why it can be so crowded it turns out that the stuffing of hekeng, dumplings, croquettes and rambutan is not stingy, hehe Thank God the Solobaru one opens the earliest.

Ô∏è (Original) Rasa standard banget, sempet kepikiran malah kenapa bisa rame bgt wkwk ternyata isian hekeng, pangsit, kroket dan rambutan nggak pelit, hehe Alhamdulillah yg Solobaru buka paling pagi.

If the fried food is still delicious, I hope the gacoan noodles will be better, even though it's already crowded but prioritize quality. (Original) Makin kesini kualitas mienya berkurang, mienya keras dan udah dingin. Pesen mie iblis lv 1 sama lv 3, yg lv 1 malah lebih pedes drpd lv 3.

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Nadiya Rahayu,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is quite spacious and there are 2 floors but there doesn't seem to be a special room for a smoking area. Even though the ceiling is quite high and at some point there is a fan, it still feels a bit hot. Visitors are very crowded and the queue for dine-in is quite long. During peak hours it may take 30-45 minutes for the main food order to arrive. The taste in all Mie Gacoan branches is the same, both are delicious, only the spiciness scale of each branch can be different. (Original) Tempat cukup luas dan terdapat 2 lantai namun sepertinya belum ada ruangan khusus untuk smoking area. Walaupun langit-langit nya cukup tinggi dan di beberapa titik ada kipas namun masih terasa agak panas. Pengunjung sangat ramai serta antrian untuk dine in cukup panjang. Pada jam ramai mungkin dibutuhkan 30-45 menit untuk pesanan makanan utamanya datang.

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Fakhrun Nisa,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Cheap and (mayan) delicious! Can you imagine how the place is, because the food is cheap and delicious ~ aside from the problem of the rather long waiting time, I think overall Gacoan Noodles can satisfy the stomach and wallet. Usually when the weekend and at meal times, Mie Gacoan will be full and impact on a very long waiting time, even until 30-45 minutes. It's only like if the waiting weekday time can be reduced by times. I came here with friends on Sunday around half past two in the afternoon, but there was still an empty table. We waited quite quickly (based on the experiences of our friends who had been waiting really long!). We waited for less than 30 minutes. Food comes at a close time so don't wait, hehe. Here there is a menu of Mie Angel, Mie Setan (savory spicy), and Mie Iblis (spicy sweet). Levels 1-4 and 6-9 (10?). As a companion of the noodles there are dumplings (really good in my opinion), dimsum, claw, shrimp spring rolls, rambutan shrimp, etc. It's delicious, according to the price. Parking for motorbikes is easy, but if you don't know the car ~ The most unfortunate thing is, many of the dealers are downstairs. Free flies roam the tables, in chairs, and around food. I'm sad ~ I don't know why but there are a lot of flies. So while eating we have to keep an eye on so that flies do not land on our food. But yeah, if it's already good, it's cheap, there are little flies, it's not an obstacle to eating at Mie Gacoan heheu Btw I eat level 4 devil noodles (Original) Murah dan (mayan) enak! Kebayang dong gimana ramenya tempat ini, karena makanannya murah dan enak~ selain masalah waktu menunggu yang agak lama, menurutku secara keseluruhan Mie Gacoan dapat memuaskan perut dan dompet. Biasanya kalau weekend dan di jam-jam makan, Mie Gacoan akan penuh dan berimbas pada waktu tunggu yang sangat lama, bahkan sampe 30-45 menitan. Cuma kayaknya kalau weekday waktu tunggunya bisa berkurang kali ya. Saya ke sini bersama teman-teman hari Minggu sekitar jam setengah 2 siang, rame tapi masih ada meja kosong. Kami menunggu lumayan cepat (berdasarkan pengalaman teman-teman yang pernah nunggu lamaaaaaaa banget!). Kami menunggu kurang dari 30 menit. Makanan datang di waktu yang berdekatan jadi gak tunggu-tungguan, hehe. Di sini ada menu Mie Angel, Mie Setan (pedas gurih), dan Mie Iblis (pedas manis). Level 1-4 dan 6-9 (10?). Sebagai pendamping mie ada pangsit (enak banget menurutku), dimsum, ceker, lumpia udang, udang rambutan, dll. Enak sih, sesuai harga. Tempat parkir motor mudah, tetapi kalau mobil kurang tahu ya~ Cuma yang paling disayangkan adalah, banyak lalernya di lantai bawah. Lalat-lalat bebas berkeliaran di meja, di kursi, dan di sekitar makanan. Sedih akutu~ gatau kenapa tapi lalatnya banyak. Jadi sembari makan kita harus terus mengawasi supaya lalat tidak hinggap di makanan kita.

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Reno Herdhiansyah,5.0,"(Translated by Google) It's similar to Me Gacoan behind the solo paragon, that's great. The place has grown wider, closer to where you live, so if you go-jek it's not far away. The location is quite strategic, in the direction of Sukoharjo if from solo right the road after turning left from the new solo pandawa intersection. It's easy. The parking lot for motorbikes is quite wide, you can line up a lot of motorbikes. But for a car it seems that you have to use the shoulder of the road. The queue is always busy, usually the ones who come here are mostly teenagers or mas gojek or grabfood to order customers. The place is wider than the me gacoan which is next to the paragon, so it is more comfortable because at the back there are many tables and chairs. So far, the taste of the noodles is delicious, whatever the level, I usually order level 3 and level 6, the dimsum dumplings are delicious, Buy noodles is always a bonus 2 fried dumplings filled with grated chicken. The amount of iced tea is delicious, the iced tea when I nyova is too sweet. But the Ice Milo is very runny, 1 sachet uses a standard glass without added sugar, it tastes bland. Hahaha It's still a favorite noodle in Solobaru, besides the price is cheap, the menu is quite complete, making an alternative for spicy food, it's really good. Eating there is okay, Gojek is okay, the queue is not as bad as the one branch. Really good. (Original) Rasanya mirip dengam Me Gacoan yang di belakang solo paragon, maknyus. Tempatnya sudah tambah luas, makin deket sama tempat tinggal jadi kalau gojek gak jauh jauh. Lokasinya lumayan strategis, ke arah sukoharjo kalau dari solo kanan jalan stelah belok kiri dari perempatan pandawa solo baru. Nyarinya gampang. Parkiran untuk sepeda motor lumayan luas, bisa jejer motor banyak. Tapi buat mobil sepertinya memang harus pakai bahu jalan. Antriannya selalu rame, biasanya yang kesini kebanyakan remaja atau mas gojek atau grabfood untuk mesenin punya customer. Tempatnya lebih luas dari me gacoan yang di samping paragon, jadi lebih nyaman karena di bagian belakang ada bnyak meja dan kursi. So far rasa mie nya enak mau level berapapun, saya biasanya mesen level 3 dan level 6, dimsum siomaynya enak, Beli mie selalu bonus 2 siomay goreng isi ayam parut. Es teh tariknya itungannya enak, es teh nya pas saya nyova sekali terlalu manis. Tapi Es Milonya encer parah, 1 sachet pake gelas standar gak dikasih tmbahan gula, rasanya hambar. Wk wk wk Masih jadi mie favorit di solobaru, selain harganya murah, menunya lumayan komplit, buat alternatif makanan pedes oke banget. Makan disana oke, gojek juga oke ngantri nya nggak se parah yg cabang satu nya. Mantapp tenan."

Mie Gacoan Solo Baru,Evan Tika Zerlanda,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Often eat here or online food. Sometimes the devil noodles taste like a lack of seasoning. Not good enough. Maybe depending on who cooked it. Different hands have different taste. As the name suggests, the devil is good at influencing someone with his trickery, to the point that I was influenced by the trick of his taste. ü§≠ It is very different from angel noodles which can make me feel more relaxed with its soft taste. üòá And maybe business brands with satanic names are cooler in today's millennial era than people's names ...
